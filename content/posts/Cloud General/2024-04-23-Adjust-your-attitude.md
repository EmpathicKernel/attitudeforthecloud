Welcome to Attitude For The Cloud!

# What is this blog?

This is a blog dedicated to helping Engineers working in the Cloud to become better and utilize the Cloud better rather you are a DevOps Engineer, Software Engineer, Platform Engineer, or {Enter Buzzword Here} Engineer.

# Why the name?

“It is your attitude, more than your aptitude, that will determine your altitude.” - Zig Ziglar

In aviation, your attitude is the pitch of your plane. If you have a good attitude, you gain altitude. Easy as that. It doesn't matter what your aptitude is when it comes to the Cloud, it's your attitude towards it that will get you higher.

# Closing remarks

I hope you will find this blog helpful and inspiring in some way, even if it becomes the example of "what not to do".
